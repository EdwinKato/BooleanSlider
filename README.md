# Boolean Slider

This is an implementation of a boolean slider using typescript and react js

## Typical usage scenario

Use this in both mobile and web for an upgrade to a checkbox.

## Usage

The control uses the Bootstrap classes "btn-primary" for true, and "btn-default" for false, so that it will pick up the colors from your theme automatically. Additionally, you may want to change the toggle (center circle), by using the following:

```css
/* color of the circle */
.wgt-BooleanSlider__toggle:before {
    background-color: #fff;
}
```
